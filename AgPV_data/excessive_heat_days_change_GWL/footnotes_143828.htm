				<h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
				<p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

				<h3>Data Differences</h3>
				<p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

				<p><b>Derivation of measure</b></p>
				<p><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Measures 1-3:</strong></p>
<p>Climate projections in the 5th National Climate Assessment (NCA5) were created from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). To make the projections more relevant at a finer geographical scale, the model outputs were downscaled and bias-corrected following protocols known as LOCA2<sup>1</sup> and STAR-ESDM.<sup>2</sup> Observed historical data were used to validate the projections and now serve as a baseline for the historical period.</p>
<p>Daily values for temperature and precipitation from observations and models were processed using documented algorithms, translating them into variables at the county scale. The derived projections estimate climatic conditions in terms of meaningful extreme temperature thresholds, averaged over several decades.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>These data are produced by the United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) for the 5th National Climate Assessment (NCA5). We selected the daily maximum and daily minimum temperature variables to estimate population exposure to extreme heat and enable linkage with health datasets. Measures are presented for four future Global Warming Levels (GWLs): 1.5&deg;C, 2&deg;C, 3&deg;C, and 4&deg;C.</p>
<p>County projections for each global warming level were calculated by identifying the year when individual climate models will reach that level. The projections were then averaged with the 9 previous years and the 10 subsequent years to represent the climatic state for that period. Using a 20-year average avoids focusing on a shorter period that may be warmer or cooler than the two-decade average.<sup>4</sup> All measures represent the projected difference in climate (heat, specifically) at the time when the selected GWL is reached in the model. The values for the simulated changes for the future are simply the difference between the future period and the reference period in days above the selected threshold. The reference period, or historical period, for comparison is 1991-2020.</p>
<p>We present extreme heat days for each combination of the following parameters: (1) absolute threshold (e.g., 95&deg;F, 100&deg;F, and 105&deg;F) and (2) Global Warming Level (1.5&deg;C, 2&deg;C, 3&deg;C, and 4&deg;C). We also present extreme heat nights for each combination of the following parameters: (1) absolute threshold (e.g., 70&deg;F) and (2) Global Warming Level (1.5&deg;C, 2&deg;C, 3&deg;C, and 4&deg;C). The average projected increase in summer temperature is presented for the average of the months of June, July, and August. Projections for all GWLs are based on the same fossil fuel intensive scenario, Shared Socio-economic Pathways 5-8.5 (SSP5-8.5).&nbsp; Global warming levels were calculated using model projections under the very high scenario, SSP5-8.5. This scenario was chosen because all model projections reach all the GWLs of interest&mdash;other scenarios do not include all four GWLS.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Measures 4-10:</strong></p>
<p>4: Projected average heat wave intensity is defined as the expected cumulative sum of daily degrees (Fahrenheit) above a dangerous level during days experiencing a heat wave. Heat waves are defined as two or more consecutive days with a maximum temperature above the 95th percent historical threshold.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5: Projected maximum heat wave temperature is the absolute hottest temperature during a heat wave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6: Projected maximum minimum temperature is the highest minimum temperature of all heat wave days in the forecast period, usually occurring at night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7: Projected average heat wave count is the average predicted number of heat waves in the forecast period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8: Projected average heat wave duration is the average number of consecutive days that the daily maximum temperature is expected to exceed a dangerous level, for each heat wave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>9: Projected number of heat exceedance days is the number of days in the forecast period when the maximum daily temperature is expected to exceed a dangerous level in the forecast month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>10: Climate Prediction Center (CPC) temperature forecast category is the predicted likelihood (chance) of whether maximum temperatures will be above normal, equal, or below normal</p>
